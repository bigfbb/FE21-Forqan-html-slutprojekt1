            <h2>Never seen Rick and Morty!!???</h2>

            <p>


                Whenever I am asked to explain the appeal of “Rick and Morty,” I propose a thought experiment.

                Imagine that you grew up with the world’s tragedies being beamed into your living room by 24-hour cable
                news. Your country has been at war for much your lifetime. You graduated college with a huge amount of
                debt, and you entered the work force during the recent financial crisis. Imagine, too, that the world’s
                ecological crisis weighs heavily on your mind and that you spend as much time on the internet as you do
                speaking to real human beings.

                If you were this sort of person, what television show would resonate with you?

                “Rick and Morty,” the Adult Swim animated comedy by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, just might be the
                answer.

                It is dark, even to the point of being nihilistic; it is absurdist; and it operates less like a novel or
                serial drama and more like a meme or internet video. It also speaks to the sense of alienation, anxiety
                and skepticism that it not uncommon among younger Americans today.

                And it has just been renewed for 70 episodes. Adult Swim announced last week that as a part of an
                overall deal with the series creators, “Rick and Morty,” which numbers 31 episodes in its first three
                seasons, will return for more than double that number.

            <H2>About Rick and Morty</H2>


            <p> Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan
                Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block, Adult Swim. The series follows the
                misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted, but fretful grandson Morty
                Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.

                Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing
                the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to
                the Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series
                has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.

                The current fifth season premiered on June 20, 2021, and consists of ten episodes. A sixth season was
                confirmed as part of a long-term deal in May 2018 that ordered 70 new episodes over an unspecified
                number of seasons.[2] </p>
